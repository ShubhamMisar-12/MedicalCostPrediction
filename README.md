# Medical Cost Prediction

[Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubhammisar/medical-cost-prediction-regression-eda)

This repository contains a project where I worked on a dataset related to medical insurance costs. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the primary beneficiary
- **sex**: Gender of the insurance contractor (female or male)
- **bmi**: Body mass index, an objective index of body weight relative to height (kg/m^2)
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance/number of dependents
- **smoker**: Smoking status
- **region**: Residential area of the beneficiary in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Project Details

I performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset and implemented regression models using linear regression and random forest algorithms to predict the impact of all the above features on medical costs.
